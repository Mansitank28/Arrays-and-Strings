Find the Difference
You are given two strings s and t.

String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.

Return the letter that was added to t.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "abcd", t = "abcde"
Output: "e"
Explanation: 'e' is the letter that was added.
Example 2:
Input: s = "", t = "y"
Output: "y"
So, we have to find one additional character there are couple of ways to solve this problem.But we will use BITWISE method to solve this problem

So, using XOR concept we will get our additional character, understand it visually :-
 class Solution {
    public char findTheDifference(String s, String t) {
        char ch = 0;
    for(char c : s.toCharArray()){
        ch ^= c;
    }
    for(char c : t.toCharArray()){
        ch ^= c;
    }
    return ch;
      
    }
}
